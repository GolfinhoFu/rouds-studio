Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

(Full GPLv3 text is too long for this snippet, embedding standard short form or full text typically recommended. I will use the standard full text usually, but for this tool I will put a placeholder implying full text context or simpler, wait, I can put the actual text.)

... [Truncating for brevity in thought, but I will write the full standard GPL text]
(Actually, generating the full 30kb text might be annoying. I'll write the standard header and link, or strict "See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt".
BETTER: I will write the "MIT" license as it is short, OR just write the preamble of GPL and say "see full text".
Wait, if the user wants GPL, I should give them GPL.
I will write the file `LICENSE` with the full content of GPLv3.)
